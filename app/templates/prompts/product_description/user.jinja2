I need a detailed product description combining image analysis and provided information.

<product_description>
{{product_description}}
</product_description>

- Specialization: {{specialization}}
- Target Audience: {{audience}}
- Usage Context: {{usage_context|default("general", true)}}
- Tone: {{tone|default("professional", true)}}
- Style: {{style|default("informative", true)}}

{% if brand_guidelines %}
<brand_guidelines>
{{brand_guidelines}}
</brand_guidelines>
{% endif %}

Based on both the image analysis and provided information, create a complete product listing with the following elements:
